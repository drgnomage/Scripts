## sample configuration file for ~/.bashbullet/config 

############  USER INFORMATION
## pushbullet api key
API_KEY=''

## oauth access token can be used instead of api key.
## please visit this url to generate a token for bashbullet ::
## https://www.pushbullet.com/authorize?client_id=0akbQhKH6bVRNi14I7bORCflh3x5K49a&redirect_uri=https://boteium.github.io/bashbullet/authed.html&response_type=token
## api_key is preferred. access token would make it inconvient for other devices to push back message.

############  PER DEVICE SETTINGS
## target device filter [ optional ]
## Bashbullet would display all pushes if no target device filter is set
## uncomment to only display pushes sent to these devices
# target_filter_0='bashbullet'
# target_filter_1='Firefox'
# target_filter_2='DEVICE NAME 2'

## uncomment to customize notification commands for corresponding devices [ optional ]
## for example : set notification timeout to 5 seconds  for the first device (target_filter_0)
# custom_command_0='notify-send -t 5000 "${TYPE} : from ${FROM} to ${TO}" "${URL} ${MSG}"'
# custom_command_1='xdg-open "${URL}"'

## uncomment to disable notification and skip inbox for corresponding devices
## thus, only custom_command would be triggered upon receiving pushes
## this would also disable notification sound as well
# skip_0=true
# skip_1=true

############  MIRROR NOTIFICATION SETTINGS
## uncomment to convert icon format and size
## ( some notification daemon only support png )
# ICONFORMAT=".png"
# ICONSIZE="-resize 32x32"

## uncomment to customize notification command for mirrored notification
# mirror_command='notify-send -i "${ICON}${ICONFORMAT}" -a "${APPS}" "${APPS} - ${FROM} :: ${TITLE}" "${URL} ${BODY}"'

## if end-to-end encryption is turned on. please enter your decryption key (NOT PASSWORD)
## to generate decryption key, use the following keygen.js command. [ require nodejs modules :: atob node-forge btoa ]
##   NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g) ./keygen.js $your_password $your_identity
## keygen.js is either located in the bashbullet folder or in /usr/share/bashbullet/
## if you don't know your identity. use the following command to retrieve it :
##   source ~/.bashbullet/config; curl -s -X GET --header "Access-Token: $API_KEY" https://api.pushbullet.com/v2/users/me|jshon -e iden
# my_key=''

## uncomment to disable sms notification
## bashbullet doesn't support SMS sync. Pushbullet won't mirror SMS notification as mirrored message either.
## thus, no push or mirrored message will be displayed on the PC upon receiving a SMS.
## but bashbullet can detect the SMS sync event and pop up a notification.
## it's not much. sender, title ,and content are all unsupported.
## if this feature is not helpful for you. you can disable it.
# disable_sms='true'

############  GLOBAL VARIABLE
## uncomment to load urls in browser automatically.
# xdg_open=true

## url shortener [ optional :: require surl python command ]
## can be replaced by any url shortener command that reads from stdin and output to stdout
## Warning :: url shortener might cause potential exposure of link. think twice before use
# SHORT_URL='surl -s is.gd'

## file link would not be shorten by default due to privacy concern
allow_file_shorten='false'

## uncomment to enable  notification sound for new push and mirrored notification
## for example : to use mpv and sound-theme-freedesktop
# DING='mpv /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga'
# DING_MIRROR='mpv /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/message.oga'

## uncomment to automatically copy links to clipboard [ require xclip command ]
## this has nothing to do with universal copy and paste.
## however, bashbullet would copy everything from phone's clipboard if universal copy-
## and-paste is enabled on the phone regardless of this setting
## But it won't copy texts from clipboard to the phone.
# cp_link=true
