## Zetetik Notes

* Sizing error - see Zetetik error 1 screenshot.
* Logged in and selecting capture management which displayed a blank dashboard section.
* What is a term of art?
* There is no explanation of the terminology used.
* Score line as an option doesn't sound right.
* Whats the difference between time line and plain list?
* Everything is left aligned, I think it would scale better if it was dynamic or center aligned.
* The search function would be great if it functioned correctly - the score function resets to 0 when the score is between 0 and 1.
* The search box doesn't go away after the search has completed.
* The select all "tick box" icon with all the dots around it is odd.
* Whats a lexicon?
* How do you print?
* Printing the page looks aweful.
* The capture lists tabs look terrible.
* Whats a red flag list? It doesn't seem to relate to severity or the like.
* The capture cards?/slides? Says $person used $program but the $program is the techincal version IE winword rather than Word from the Office Suite.
